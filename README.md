ICDO: International Classification of Diseases Ontology

ICDO is an ontology representation of ICD. This ICD ontology (ICDO)logically represent ICD terms and their relations with anatomic entities, qualities, etc. Different from other disease ontologies, all ICD diseases are defined disease processes in ICDO. The current ICDO focuses on English and Chinese representation. ICDO can identify and standardize local ICD versions and will be used to integrate ICD related data. 

The ICDO developers include Dr. Ling (Eric) Wan, Justin Song, Virginia He, Edison Ong, and Yongqun (Oliver) He. We appreciate the support by Ms. Meiu Wong, Dr. Xubin Song, and many other. 

The ICDO work was first presented as an oral presentation by Dr. Ling (Eric) Wan in the 10th International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO-2019), August 1, 2019, Buffalo.

More collaborations are welcome! Thanks!
